C# Fundamentals Video 7: Operators, Expressions & Statements

Operands = strings, variables, objects. They are like **nouns** in English. 

Operators = +, -, (), ; They are like **verbs** in English. 

Many built in operators that you should memorize because you will be using 90-95% of the time. 

How you **express** yourself in C#. 

Statements consist of expressions. 

Expressions consist of operands and operators. 



```c#
using System;

namespace OperatorsExpressionsStatements
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // Variable declaration
            int x, y, a b;       
						// Assignment operator
            x = 3;
            y = 2;
            a = 1;
            b = 0;

            // There are many mathematical operators . . .

            // Addtition operator
            x = 3 + 4;

            // Subtraction operator
            x = 4 - 3;

            // Multiplication operator
            x = 10 * 5;

            // Division operator
            x = 10 / 5;

            // Order of operations using parentheses
            x = (x + y) * (a - b);

            // There are many operators used to evaluate values . . .

            // Equality operator
            if (x ==y)
            {

            }

            // Greater than operator
            if (x > y)
            {

            }

            // Less than operator
            if (x < y)
            {

            }

            // Greater or equal to operator
            if (x >= y)
            {

            }

            // Less than or equal to operator
            if (x <= y)
            {

            }

            // There are two conditional operators as well that can be used to expand / enhance and evaluation and they can be combined together multiple times

            // Conditional AND operator

            if ((x > y) && (a > b))
            {

            }

            // Conditional OR operator
            if ((x > y) || (a > b))
            {

            }

            // Also here's the in-line conditional operator we learned about in a previous lesson the ternary operator
            string message = (x == 1) ? "Car" : "Boat";

            // Member access . and Method Invocation ()
            Console.WriteLine("Hi");
}   

}
```

Notes from class

## Loops and Strings

### Conditional -   **IF**

have to wrap body of if in () and then have {}

```c#
if (name=="Omar")

{

//do stuff

}
```



### Conditional -  Else If

as  many else if as you want, but not recommended

preferred for boolean values

### Conditional - Switch Statement 

for more than 3 items you are checking

can only compare expressions based on a single value unlike an if else where you can compare for a range (like x >=10 && x <= 20)



## For Loops (simple) 

when you have a definite range you want to iterate through

```c#
for (i=0, i<=10, i++)

{ 
    Console.WriteLine(i);

}
```

## For each



most commonly used

when you have an indefinite collection of items you want to gain access to or manipulate

```c#
foreach(var name in listOfNames)

{
    Console.WriteLine(name);
    listOfNames.remove(name);

}
```



## While Loop

```c#
while(i<10)

{

//do stuff;

}
```



## Do While

```c#
Do

{ //some stuff;

}
```

while this condition is true - do stuff

will always run once

needs incrementor or decrementor

can use break to get out of loop if some condition is met.

 a do-while loop is very similar to a while loop, but it has its check at the end of the loop block. this means we'll always  run the block at least once.  

## Dictionaries

key value pair storage (k,v)

```c#
Dictionary>string, int>myDictionary = new Dictionary<string, int>();

myDictionary.add("myKey, 23");
```

var item1 = myDictionary["myKey"]  --> 23 (retrieving an item)

## Looping Through the Dictionary

```c#
foreach(KeyValuePair<string, int> entry in my Dictionary)

{

//do something with entry.Value or entry.Key

}
```



## String vs. Stringbuilder

string is immutable

stringbuilder class is mutable. best used when you will be doing lot of manipulations on the string. 

(grab examples for notes)



 ## Data Collections

C# provides powerful and flexible structures to store data, known as [collections](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt654013.aspx).  

### Ordered Data: Lists and Arrays

### Lists

 A `List` in C# is very similar to a list in Python, with one  important difference. Unlike Python, where lists can contain any type of value, in C# we must let the compiler know what kind of objects our  list is going to contain. 

 use the C# `List` type to store simple sets of data.  

### List Methods and Properties

 Refer to the [official documentation on the `List` class](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/6sh2ey19(v=vs.110).aspx) for a more comprehensive reference. 

| Name       | Type     | Description                                                  | Example                      |
| ---------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| `Count`    | Property | Represents the number of items in the list, as an `int`      | `students.Count`             |
| `Add`      | Method   | Adds an item to the list                                     | `students.Add("Sally")`      |
| `Contains` | Method   | Checks to see if the list contains a given item, returning a boolean | `students.Contains("Haley")` |
| `IndexOf`  | Method   | Looks for an item in a list, returning the index of the first occurance of the item if contained in the list, -1 otherwise | `students.IndexOf("Zach")`   |
| `Sort`     | Method   | Sorts a list, uses the default sort comparison               | `students.Sort()`            |
| `ToArray`  | Method   | Returns an array containing the elements of the list         | `students.ToArray()`         |

## Arrays

C# has lists and arrays

 *arrays are of fixed siz*e

 You can not expand or contract an array after it is created, so you must know exactly how many elements it will need to hold when you create it. This is why lists are preferred in most cases. 

 Like lists, we can index into arrays with integers.  Unlike lists, however, there is no analog of `.Add()`, which  adds an item to "the end" of a list. We must always access and assign  array elements using an explicit index. This makes for code that can  seem littered wit h array counters (like our friends `i` and `j`) and is more difficult to read (not to mention more error-prone). 

 Like lists, however, we can loop through an array using a `foreach` loop as long as we don't need to use the index of the current item. 

 You should rely on lists to store collections of values, or ordered data.
