# C# 3.1 Notes

- object oriented -> class based
- strongly typed -> you have to specify data type
- everything ends with a semicolon (except when defining a namespace, class, or method
- bad formatting or indentation will not break your code but is frowned upon

## Variable declaration

```c#
double price = 20.99;

string name = "john"; 

int age = 34;
```

when you use var keyword, type is determined by the compiler

`var name "John";`  => `string name "John"`
quicker, easier to define your variables

class and object

```c#
class Dog 
{
	public Dog()

}
```



## Namespace 
used to organize your applications into a named group that lets the compiler know that everything in that namespace is related. 

```c#
Namespace HelloWorld //namespace
{
  Class Program //Classes
{
	static void Public (string [] args)	
{
	string name = "no name";
}
public Dog(string name)
{
	string name = "Roy";
}
}
  
 class myNewDogObject = new Dog();
```
 (new instance of class Dog, which is an object)

## Reference vs. Value Types

- Value types: string, int, bool, etc. anything that holds a value
- Reference types: classes, objects, arrays, etc. Hold a reference or pointer to the object but is not the actual value

## Arrays

ordered fixed length collection, strongly typed.

use when you know your data will not grow

```c#
int[]myArray = new int[10]:
```



## Lists

Use anytime your data will resize (add items, remove items)

```c#
List<string>myList = new List<string>();
foreach(string name in myLIst)

{

	myList.Add("stuff")

}
```

## Static methods

```c#
program myObject =new program():

myObject
```

available globally where you don't create instances of those items

```c#
Public Static void Main()
```

**public**: access modifier

**static** means you can't create an instance of this class to use the method

**void:** return type

- ​	this function is not going to return anything. 
- ​	it's doing something but not giving output

**main**: method name



## String Interpolation

```c#
var name = "John";

Console.WriteLine($Hello {name}. Nice to meet you.");
```

## Grab user input

```c#
int response = Console.ReadLine();
```
